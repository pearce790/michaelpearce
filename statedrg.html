            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              Since Fall 2019, this reading group has been meeting to explore topics in statistics education, primarily at the undergraduate level.
              Broad areas of interest include pedagogical techniques, distinctions between data science and statistics with regard to teaching, 
              inclusivity and ethics in the classroom, and how to incorporate the interdisciplinary aspects of statistics into introductory coursework.
