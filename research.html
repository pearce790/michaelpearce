              Rankings and scores are two common data types used by judges to express preferences and/or perceptions of quality in a collection of 
              objects. Numerous models exist to study data of each type separately, but no unified statistical model captures both data types simultaneously 
              without first performing data conversion. We propose the Mallows-Binomial model to close this gap, which combines a Mallows ranking model 
              with Binomial score models through shared parameters that quantify object quality, a consensus ranking, and the level of consensus among 
              judges. We propose an efficient tree-search algorithm to calculate the exact MLE of model parameters, study statistical properties of the 
              model both analytically and through simulation, and apply our model to real data from an instance of grant panel review that collected 
              both scores and partial rankings. Furthermore, we demonstrate how model outputs can be used to rank objects with confidence. The proposed 
              model is shown to sensibly combine information from both scores and rankings to quantify object quality and measure consensus with appropriate 
              levels of statistical uncertainty. The work was published in July 2022 in the <a href="https://www.jmlr.org/papers/v23/21-1262.html">Journal of 
              Machine Learning Research</a>, with additional theoretical results regarding bootstrap validity published on

              In this project with Professor Adrian E. Raftery, we quantified the human lifespan using a statistical approach that probabilistically forecasts the maximum reported age at 
              death (MRAD) through 2100. Using the existing exponential survival model for supercentenarians (people over age 110), we quantify population uncertainty using Bayesian population projections and incorporate
              the most recent data from the <a href="https://www.supercentenarians.org/">International Database on Longevity</a> to obtain unconditional estimates of the distribution of MRAD this century in a fully Bayesian analysis.

              This NSF-funded project was completed as a senior undergraduate student at St. Olaf College as part of the 
              <a href="https://wp.stolaf.edu/cir/">Center for Interdisciplinary Research</a>. We developed a new methodology to read and analyze pairs of
              molecular tagging velocimetry images, a technique for studying high-speed gaseous flows in a chemical experiment. The proposed method de-noises and 
              processes the original images and then uses a variety of nonparametric techniques to create high-resolution two-component velocity fields. Our results are
              compared against numerous existing alternatives and shown to improve accuracy and resolution in a variety of cases. This work was published in 2020 in
              the journal <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6501/abb1e4/meta">Measurement Science and Technology</a>.
