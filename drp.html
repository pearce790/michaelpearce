            <p class="text">
              In addition to my more formal experiences as a teaching assistant, I've led numerous projects with undergraduate students as part of the UW
              Statistics Directed Reading Program (DRP). The one-on-one experiences are intended to help undergraduates from a wide variety of backgrounds
              gain exposure to areas of statistics not often covered in the curriculum and learn about life as a graduate student and researcher. For more 
              details of the program, click <a href="https://spa-drp.github.io/">here</a>. Below are the titles, prequisites, descriptions, and syllabi 
              of my DRP offerings.

            <h3>Nonlinear Regression (Winter 2020, Winter 2021)</h3>
            <p class="text">
              <i> Students:</i> Oliver Bejar Tjalve, Alejandro Gonzalez
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <i> Prerequisites:</i> A basic knowledge of linear regression and some experience in R.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <i> Description:</i> Simple linear regression models can be easy to implement and interpret, but they don't always fit data well! 
              For this project, we'll explore regression methods that relax the assumption of linearity. These might include (based on the interest 
              and/or experience level of the student) polynomial regression, step functions, regression splines, smoothing splines, multivariate 
              adaptive regression splines, and generalized additive models. Hopefully, we'll even see how to validate such models using cross-validation! 
              We will mostly use James et al.'s "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (ISLR) Chapter 7.

            <h3>History and Practice of Data Communication (Autumn 2020)</h3>
            <p class="text">
              <i> Student:</i> Ziyi Li
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <i> Prerequisites:</i> None; some experience with R or Python may be helpful but is not required.
            </p>
            <p class="text">
              <i> Description:</i> In this course, we'll learn about the development of data communication techniques and their modern use. We'll begin by 
              studying how people have visualized patterns in data over time, and consider how those methods reflected the computational resources 
              available in each era. Then, we'll shift our attention to modern issues in data communication, drawing examples from the COVID-19 
              pandemic and 2020 US presidential election: How do practitioners effectively show complex relationships or model uncertainty? How 
              do people mislead readers through text and figures (intentionally or otherwise)? What common pitfalls exist, and how can we avoid them? 
              We'll finish with a data communication project based on the student's interests.
