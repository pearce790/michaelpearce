            <hr>
            <p class="text">
              I am a fifth-year PhD candidate in statistics at the <a href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/">University of 
              Washington</a>. My primary research interests include preference learning, peer review, and Bayesian models applied to the social sciences.
              I currently work with <a href="https://sites.stat.washington.edu/elena/">Elena Erosheva</a> on unified modeling of scores and rankings 
              in peer review and other social science applications. Previously, I worked with 
              <a href="https://www.stat.washington.edu/raftery/">Adrian Raftery</a> 
              on probabilistic forecasting of supercentenarian survival using Bayesian population projections. In addition to research, I am actively 
              involved in the statistics teaching community at UW. In addition to serving as a teaching assistant, I am a co-founder and organizer
              of a <a href="https://pearce790.github.io/statedrg.html">reading group in statistics education</a>, 
              7-time undergraduate <a href="https://spa-drp.github.io/">Directed Reading Program</a> mentor, and 
              served on a committee to update and modernize the department's undergraduate curriculum. I have spent two summers as an 
              Applied Statistics intern with the Applied Math 
              research group at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/boeingresearch&technology/">Boeing Research and Technology</a>. 
              Prior to grad school I
              consulted for Deloitte in data analytics, specifically working with banking and financial services clients.

              In my free time, I enjoy running and biking along Puget Sound's beautiful waterways and trails, bouldering, baking cookies or cakes, going to the 
              many breweries in my neighborhood, and reading memoirs. In 2020, I completed a quest to visit every one of Seattle's 413 city parks by my 
              own power - either running or biking! You can visualize all the parks I visited
