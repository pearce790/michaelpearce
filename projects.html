    <p> Here are the syllabi from my two UW Stat Directed Reading Program (DRP) Projects.</p>
  <h4> Winter 2020: Nonlinear Regression</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> A basic knowledge of linear regression and some experience in R
  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> Simple linear regression models can be easy to implement and interpret, but they don't always fit data well! For this project, we'll explore regression methods that relax the assumption of linearity. These might include (based on the interest and/or experience level of the student) polynomial regression, step functions, regression splines, smoothing splines, multivariate adaptive regression splines, and generalized additive models. Hopefully, we'll even see how to validate such models using cross-validation! We will mostly use James et al.'s "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" Chapter 7.
  </li>

  <h4> Autumn 2020: History and Practice of Data Communication</h4>
  <p class="content" style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;">
      <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> <i> Prerequisites: </i> None; some experience with R or Python may be helpful but is not required
  </li>
  <li style="padding:0px;margin:0px 20px 0px;"> In this course, we'll learn about the development of data communication techniques and their modern use. We'll begin by studying how people have visualized patterns in data over time, and consider how those methods reflected the computational resources available in each era. Then, we'll shift our attention to modern issues in data communication, drawing examples from the COVID-19 pandemic and 2020 US presidential election: How do practitioners effectively show complex relationships or model uncertainty? How do people mislead readers through text and figures (intentionally or otherwise)? What common pitfalls exist, and how can we avoid them? We'll finish with a data communication project based on the student's interests.
